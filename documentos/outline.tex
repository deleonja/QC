According to \cite{nielsen_chuang_2011}, an arbitrary density matrix on $n$  
qubits can be expanded as
\begin{align}
	\rho = \frac{1}{2^n}\sum _{\vec{v}} \Tr 
                  \qty( \sigma _{v_1} \otimes \sigma_{v_2} \otimes 
               \cdots \otimes \sigma_{v_n} \rho) \sigma _{v_1} \otimes 
             \sigma_{v_2} \otimes \ldots \otimes \sigma_{v_n},
	\label{rho}
\end{align}
where the sum is over vectors $\vec{v}=\qty(v_1,\cdots, v_n)$ with entries
$v_i$ chosen from the set $\{0,1,2,3\}$. We label the coefficients $\Tr \qty(
\sigma _{v_1} \otimes \sigma_{v_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \sigma_{v_n}
\rho )$ as $r_{v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n}$ to shorten the notation. 

The kind of maps that act on density matrices of the form \eqref{rho} that
we're interested in are those which leave invariant or erase the 
coefficients
in $\rho$ (i.e. $r'_{v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n}=r_{v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n}$ or
$r'_{v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n}=0$, where the primed $r$'s refer to the 
coefficients in the transformed density matrix $\rho '$). 

So far, with a numerical method we've characterized all 1 and 2 qubit maps, 
whereas for 3 qubits system we have studied maps that leave invariant 1, 2, 
3 and 4 coefficients in $\rho$. Our results exhibit the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Valid quantum channels are only found for maps that leave invariant
				a power of 2 number of coefficients, meaning it is a necessary
				condition but not sufficient for characterizing this kind of 
				maps. We have not found an explanation for that.
				
	\item 
% There's not a relation 1-on-1 for the number of possible maps that leave
% invariant a certain number of coefficients with the number valid quantum
% channels found. It seems that 

%				Not only the number of coefficients to leave
%				invariant is taken into account but actually which coefficients 
%				are left invariant too. 

				As a consequence of the previous item, not only the number of 
				coefficients to leave invariant is taken into account but actually
				which coefficientes are left invariant too.
				
	\item Valid maps for $n$ qubits must be valid for subsets of qubits. For example, 
% \item The results are recursive by increasing the number of qubits in the
% system, i.e. the valid quantum channels for 2 qubits have to obey the valid
% quantum channels for 1 qubit. In more detail, 
the 2-qubits quantum-channels
that leave invariant any of the coefficients of the form $r_{v_1,0}$ or
$r_{0,v_2}$ have to obey the valid quantum channels found for 1 qubit. 
This induces nice rules that are not accessible (we think) by considering 
a single $2^n$-level quantum system. {\color{red} [Nota]
No entiendo la utilidad de este punto. Salvo la regla que nos permite ver si el canal es un producto tensorial de canales (o no), no se a que otras reglas se refieren. Claramente un producto tensorial de canales es tal que los 1s internos coinciden con los 1s en las orillas. Si se especificar√° mas este punto, propongo borrarlo, creo que mete ruido.}
\end{itemize}

The results for 2 qubits where classified in the following manner: 
the resulting density matrices from applying valid quantum channels
to an arbitrary density matrix where arranged in `equivalence classes' 
such that elements in a class are connected by tranposition or 
permutations of the rows or columns 1, 2 and 3. The equivalence classes do not 
depend solely on the number of components left invariant in $\rho$. 
For example, four equivalence classes are found for quantum channels
that leave 4 components invariant.

We would like to
\begin{itemize}
	\item search for simple rules to generate the elements 
				of the equivalence classes,
	\item verify if there are unitary transformations that connect elements of
				different classes.
\end{itemize}
